        <p>About me: I turned 20 this year, and I have lived in utah my whole life. Although, I love to travel and visit new places. Some of the places that I really want to visit are:[Australia]<link(https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1025960785-2560x1300.jpg)>, [Japan](https://www.japan.travel/en/), [Korea](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/). All of those places just seem like amazing places to explore and have fun for a while. Other than that I have been to many different states..</p>
